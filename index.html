                                Dental implants are a marvel of technology, immitating real teeth and acting very much like your natural tooth
                                root in your jaw bone. These small titanium anchors are permanently anchored into your upper and/or lower jaw bone,
                                which over time integrate with your bone. This connection slows bone loss because it is acting like a tooth root.
                                Frankly, that's amazing!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The LOCATOR&#174; Attachment has a drastically reduced vertical height, providing you with comfort when the denture is removed,
                                as well as increase denture strength when compared to other implant solutions.

                                The problem with many prosthodontic teeth is they're not shaped like your original teeth, nor are they colored
                                to look natural. Genios&#174; Premium Denture Teeth have been crafted to look impressively natural thanks to its unique multi-zone
                                design with distinct colors and excellent surface texture. The anterior teeth have patented inter-tooth closures, ensuring harmonious
                                connections with adjacent teeth. Posteriors have occlusal surfaces, meaning the teeth on upper and lower dentures fit together perfectly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Genios&#174; teeth are expertly fitted into a handcrafted overdenture by clinicians at GP Denture Clinic, giving you the best
                                possible denture experience.

                        and Genios&#174; teeth, set in a handcrafted overdenture by Grande Prairie Denture Clinic.</p>

                            <strong>Teeth that look and act real</strong>
                            <br/>
                            Unlike traditional man-made teeth, Genios® teeth are uniquely made to look impressively natural, in colouring and harmonious fit.

                            <strong>Stimulates Jawbone, Slowing Bone Loss</strong>
                            <br/>
                            Your natural teeth stimulate your jawbone when chewing. Implants have the same effect, mimicking your natural teeth and slowing resorption (shrinkage). Resorption happens naturally when teeth are missing.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Promotes Better Digestion</strong>
                            <br/>
                            Pure Genios&#174; Denture Solutions overdentures utilize implants, which are more stable than adhesive dentures. Having an overdenture allows you to chew food thoroughly, helping your stomach break food down more efficiently, and absorb more nutrients.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Retain Facial Features and Structure</strong>
                            <br/>
                            Overdentures help improve facial contours that result in minimizing premature wrinkles. Missing teeth can also cause the distance between nose and chin to shrink. Implants slow this natural process, preventing the shrinking face, "sunken-in" look.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Higher Level of Comfort</strong>
                            <br/>
                            Dentures on both upper and lower jaws are more comfortable. When held in by implants, the denture fits more securely than on held in with adhesives. The overdenture also reduces or eliminates unnecessary movement during chewing and talking. Feel secure that your denture isn't going to "pop out" all by itself, and that you'll have far fewer sores!

                                    <p>Even with a fitted removable full denture, you have about 20% of the chewing efficiency of a person with natural teeth. The problem becomes worse with aging when  you lose more jawbone and dentures do not fit well. Your ill-fitting dentures make it difficult to eat certain foods. Overdentures can significantly restore your chewing efficiency and allow the patient to eat properly. You will also be less restricted with your diet and follow a more normal diet.</p>
